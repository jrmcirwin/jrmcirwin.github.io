I study maternal-infant health in both contemporary and historical populations. One part of my dissertation studies the drivers of maternal-infant health in 21st-century Senegal, as well as the consequences of maternal deprivation for inter-generational health.

The second part of my dissertation develops and applies a new indicator for maternal-infant health in historical populations: childhood sex ratios. Using sex-ratio data, we provide new estimates of infant mortality for the 19th-century US.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of health and 'development' -- whether in 19th-century North America or 21st-century Senegal.
