I study maternal-infant health in both contemporary and historical populations. One of my projects studies the effects of food insecurity on maternal-infant health in Senegal. 

In another project, I develop and apply a new indicator for maternal-infant health in historical populations: childhood sex ratios. Using sex-ratio data, we provide new estimates of infant mortality for the 19th-century US.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of health and 'development' -- whether in 19th-century North America or 21st-century Senegal.
