I study maternal-infant health in both contemporary and historical populations. One of my projects studies the effects of food insecurity on maternal-infant health in Senegal. 

In another project, I develop and apply a new indicator for maternal-infant health in historical populations: childhood sex ratios. Using sex-ratio data, we provide new estimates of infant mortality for the 19th-century US.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of health and 'development' -- whether in 19th-century North America or 21st-century Senegal.

    <summary> Childhood Sex Ratios Reveal Infant Mortality ([link](https://jrmcirwin.github.io/sr1/DemPap_1.pdf))</summary>
    <ul> 
      _We offer a new approach to characterizing broad patterns of infant mortality, using childhood sex ratios. Girls are hardier than boys, with lower rates of infant mortality unless their biological advantage is offset by sex discrimination. Therefore, high levels of infant mortality tend to skew the surviving population toward females. Extremes of male-biased sex ratios are familiar as indicators of missing women, but the potential for sex-ratio data to reveal patterns of infant mortality estimates has gone largely unnoticed. We document the relationship between infant mortality and childhood sex ratios in historical data from Europe and its settler colonies, showing that broad patterns of infant mortality can be inferred from sex-ratio data. Widely available from census data, childhood sex ratios can shed new light on infant mortality and maternal health in populations lacking mortality data._

    <summary> US Infant Mortality in the 19th Century: New Evidence from Childhood Sex Ratios ([link](https://jrmcirwin.github.io/sr1/USimr.pdf)) </summary>
    <ul>
    _High rates of infant mortality tend to skew childhood sex ratios toward females, so sex ratio data offer a basis for characterizing infant mortality in populations lacking vital statistics. Using sex ratios from the US census, we find infant mortality for US whites was just over 80 deaths per 1000 births in the mid-nineteenth century. Less than one-half the level found by existing estimates, our results suggest a major revision to prevailing views of nineteenth-century US infant mortality, with white IMR less than one-quarter that of enslaved Blacks._

    <summary> Infant Anemia and Food Crises in Senegal (_in progress_) </summary>
    <ul>
    _Senegal depends heavily on both imported foodstuffs and rainfed agriculture. Both are subject to crises, whether due to food price volatility on the international market or due to delayed onset of the rainy season. I study the impact of such crises on maternal-infant health. This includes immediate effects on birth outcomes and infant anemia, as well as the long-term effects of _in-utero_ exposure to these food crises on human capital outcomes._
