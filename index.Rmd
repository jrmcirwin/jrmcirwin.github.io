Hello world! I am a [cedar-strip canoe](canoe.jpg) builder (on leave) and 4th-year PhD student in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University. Trained as an economist, I do interdisciplinary research on health and demography.
