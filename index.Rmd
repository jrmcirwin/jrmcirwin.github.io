## Bio

Hello world! I am a [Harper-Schmidt Fellow](https://college.uchicago.edu/faculty/society-of-fellows) (Collegiate Assistant Professor) at the University of Chicago, where I teach Global Society in the [College Core](https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/core/social-sciences-core). Trained as a quantitative social scientist, I do interdisciplinary research on demography and population health.

Before joining the University of Chicago, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the [Center for Economic History](https://sites.northwestern.edu/cfeh/) at Northwestern University. In 2024, I obtained a PhD in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) from Columbia University. 

When not on campus, you're most likely to find me [wilderness canoeing](images/canoe.jpg), enjoying the [Chicago lake shore](images/PXL_20250715_121231351.jpg), or reading sci-fi and fantasy ([current recommendation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries)).
