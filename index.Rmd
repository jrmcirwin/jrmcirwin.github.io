Hello world! I am a PhD candidate in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University. 

Trained as an economist, I do interdisciplinary research on health and demography. I enjoy teaching and am a lecturer at the University of Chicago. I also build [cedar-strip canoes](images/canoe.jpg).
