Hello world! I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [Center for Economic History](https://sites.northwestern.edu/cfeh/) at Northwestern University. I obtained a PhD in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University in 2024.

Trained as an economist, I do interdisciplinary research on health and demography. I am also passionate about teaching and lecture part time at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. I also build [cedar-strip canoes](images/canoe.jpg).
