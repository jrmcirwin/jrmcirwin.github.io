One part of my dissertation studies the drivers of\nmaternal-infant health in 21st-century Senegal, as well as the\nconsequences of maternal deprivation for inter-generational health.\nThe second part of my dissertation develops and applies a new\nindicator for maternal-infant health in historical populations:\nchildhood sex ratios. Using sex-ratio data, we provide new estimates of\ninfant mortality for the 19th-century US.\nBroadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of health and\n‘development’ – whether in 19th-century North America or 21st-century\nSenegal.\nWork in Progress\nChildhood Sex Ratios Reveal Infant Mortality (link)\nUS Infant Mortality in the 19th Century: New Evidence from\nChildhood Sex Ratios (link)\nInfant Anemia and the 2008 World Food Price Crisis in Senegal\n(in progress)\n\n\n\n",
