One of my projects studies the effects of food insecurity\non maternal-infant health in Senegal.\nIn another project, I develop and apply a new indicator for\nmaternal-infant health in historical populations: childhood sex ratios.\nUsing sex-ratio data, we provide new estimates of infant mortality for\nthe 19th-century US.\nBroadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of health and\n‘development’ – whether in 19th-century North America or 21st-century\nSenegal.\nWorks in Progress\nClick title for abstract:\n\nChildhood Sex Ratios Reveal Infant Mortality (link)\nWe offer a new approach to characterizing broad patterns of infant\nmortality, using childhood sex ratios. Girls are hardier than boys, with\nlower rates of infant mortality unless their biological advantage is\noffset by sex discrimination. Therefore, high levels of infant mortality\ntend to skew the surviving population toward females. Extremes of\nmale-biased sex ratios are familiar as indicators of missing women, but\nthe potential for sex-ratio data to reveal patterns of infant mortality\nestimates has gone largely unnoticed. We document the relationship\nbetween infant mortality and childhood sex ratios in historical data\nfrom Europe and its settler colonies, showing that broad patterns of\ninfant mortality can be inferred from sex-ratio data. Widely available\nfrom census data, childhood sex ratios can shed new light on infant\nmortality and maternal health in populations lacking mortality\ndata.\n\nUS Infant Mortality in the 19th Century: New Evidence from Childhood Sex\nRatios (link)\nHigh rates of infant mortality tend to skew childhood sex ratios\ntoward females, so sex ratio data offer a basis for characterizing\ninfant mortality in populations lacking vital statistics. Using sex\nratios from the US census, we find infant mortality for US whites was\njust over 80 deaths per 1000 births in the mid-nineteenth century. Less\nthan one-half the level found by existing estimates, our results suggest\na major revision to prevailing views of nineteenth-century US infant\nmortality, with white IMR less than one-quarter that of enslaved\nBlacks.\n\nInfant Anemia and Food Crises in Senegal (in progress)\nSenegal depends heavily on both imported foodstuffs and rainfed\nagriculture. Both are subject to crises, whether due to food price\nvolatility on the international market or due to delayed onset of the\nrainy season. I study the impact of such crises on maternal-infant\nhealth. This includes immediate effects on birth outcomes and infant\nanemia, as well as the long-term effects of in-utero exposure\nto these food crises on human capital outcomes.\n\n\n\n",
