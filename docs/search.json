One of my projects studies the effects of food insecurity on maternal-infant health in Senegal.\nIn another project, I develop and apply a new indicator for maternal-infant health in historical populations: childhood sex ratios. Using sex-ratio data, we provide new estimates of infant mortality for the 19th-century US.\nBroadly speaking, I am interested in the interplay of health and ‘development’ – whether in 19th-century North America or 21st-century Senegal.\nPublications\n\nChild Anemia and the 2008 Food Price Crisis in Senegal (forthcoming at Demographic Research, link)\nI estimate the effects of the 2008 food price crisis on child hemoglobin in Senegal. Early-life hemoglobin reflects in-utero iron deposition, making it a bio-marker for maternal malnutrition. By comparing children in-utero during the 2008 crisis to those who were breastfeeding, I develop a quasi-experimental framework to quantify the impact of the 2008 crisis on maternal-infant health. I find large negative impacts of the crisis in urban Senegal, and no impact in rural areas. The effect was largest in Dakar, where it implied a more than doubling of the prevalence childhood anemia, from 1-in-3 children to 3-in-4.\nWorking Papers\n\nUS Infant Mortality in the 19th Century: New Evidence from Childhood Sex Ratios (under review, link)\nWe offer a new empirical basis for characterizing infant mortality: childhood sex ratios. Because males are biologically more vulnerable than females to infant mortality, high rates of infant death tend to be reflected in female-skewed childhood sex ratios. Assembling historical vital statistics and census data, we document a striking relationship between childhood sex ratios and infant mortality. Based on that relationship, we provide new estimates of infant mortality for the nineteenth-century US, a population for whom we lack vital statistics but have rich census data. We find that infant mortality for US whites was roughly 70–80 deaths per 1000 in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nRacial Health Inequities in the 19th Century US: Evidence from Childhood Sex\nRatios (revision in progress, link)\nWe introduce childhood sex ratios as a novel indicator of infant mortality and maternal-infant health. Because females have a biological survival advantage in infancy, high rates of infant death tend to skew the surviving population toward females. Using data from 19th-century Europe and settler societies, we document the relationship between infant mortality and under-5 sex ratios. We then apply this relationship to characterize infant mortality for the 19th-century US, where we have census data but not vital statistics. By our estimates, the Black-white infant mortality disparity in the 19th-century US was enormous: nearly 250 points (per 1000 births) . Circa 1850, US whites were among the healthiest of contemporary populations, with 3.3% more males than females in the under-5 population, suggesting infant mortality around 80 deaths per 1000. US Blacks were among the most unhealthy, with 2.2% more females than males in the under-5 population, suggesting infant mortality around 320 deaths per 1000.\n\nChildhood Sex Ratios Reveal Infant Mortality (revision in progress, link)\nWe offer a new approach to characterizing broad patterns of infant mortality, using childhood sex ratios. Girls are hardier than boys, with lower rates of infant mortality unless their biological advantage is offset by sex discrimination. Therefore, high levels of infant mortality tend to skew the surviving population toward females. Extremes of male-biased sex ratios are familiar as indicators of missing women, but the potential for sex-ratio data to reveal patterns of infant mortality estimates has gone largely unnoticed. We document the relationship between infant mortality and childhood sex ratios in historical data from Europe and its settler colonies, showing that broad patterns of infant mortality can be inferred from sex-ratio data. Widely available from census data, childhood sex ratios can shed new light on infant mortality and maternal health in populations lacking mortality data.\n\n\n\n",
