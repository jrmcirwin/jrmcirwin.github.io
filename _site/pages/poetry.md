I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew.
I sang of wind and wind there came, and in the branches blew.
Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,
and by the strand in Ilmarin there grew a golden tree.
Beneath the stars of Ever-eve, in Eldamar it shown,
in Eldamar beside the walls of elven Tirion.
There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,
while here beyond the Sundering Sea now fall the elven tears.
O Lorien! the winter comes, the bare and leafless day.
The leaves are falling in the stream, the river runs away.
O Lorien! too long I've dwelt, upon this hither shore,
and woven in a fading crown the golden elanor.
But if of ships I now should sing, what ships would come to me,
what ships would bear me ever back, across so wide a see.
